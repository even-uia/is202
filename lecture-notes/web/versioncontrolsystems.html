    <h2>Version Control Systems</h2>
    <p>Version Control Systems (VCS), or Source Code Control Systems, are
      essential tools in all real-life system development projects.  They
      provide a robust and secure way of sharing the source code between the
      developers. They fill the role of project archive, and in the archive
      (or repositories they are commonly called) there will be backups that
      a developer can fall back on after various disasters. It will also
      be possible to revert to a snapshot of the code made at important
      moments in time, e.g. a delivery to the customer.</p>

    <h3>What do vc systems do?</h3>
    <p>An important part of any vc systems is the repository. The repository
      is where the source code is stored. Then there is the client, which each
      developer will use to maintain his working copy.  The working copy is
      the developers own copy the files from the repository. The client compares
      the working copy with the contents of the repository, and can update the
      repository with the changes made by the developer, or it can update
      the working copy with changes made by other members of the team.</p>

    <p>When updating to or from the working copy, a conflict can occur. A
      conflict happens when two developers have made changes to the same file,
      that are so intertwined that the merging algorithm cannot cope.</p>

    <p>When there are no conflicts, or all have been resolved, the update is
      accepted into the repository.  The remembers all updates it receives,
      when they happened and what the changes were. So you can get back to any
      old version of the system, provided you remember when that version
      was merged into the repository. However this is a very useful operation,
      because it allows the team to recreate, for example, the latest published
      version of the system, in a couple of minutes, so it can be tested
      or debugged.</p>

    <h3>Choosing a version control system</h3>
    <p>There are two major types of version control systems: Centralized
      systems and distributed version control systems.   Subversion and Git
      are the most widespread open-source version control systems of each type</p>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system. Distributed means that
      there is not just one repository. In fact every project member will have
      their own copy of the "master" repository. (Master in quotes, because
      having a master repository isn't necessary. It's just an agreement
      within the project that the contributions from all members shall be
      merged into a particular repository</p>


    <h3>GIT</h3>
    <p>The text below describes how to set up and use a git repository on
      GitHub. All group members must register as users of github. To register:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to https://github.com</li>
      <li>Enter a username, you email, and password</li>
      <li>Click on the green button at the bottom of the form</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Creating a repository</h4>
    <p>The actions described under this heading should only be carried
      out once, by the repository owner (the group member who created it).
      You will not need more than one master repository.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Log in on github</li>
      <li>Click the little '+' in the upper right corner of the page</li>
      <li>Select new repository</li>
      <li>In the new repository form enter a name for the repository.
        In the description field you may enter something like: my group's
        project repository"</li>
      <li>Leave the rest as it is, and click on <kbd>Create repository</kbd></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Before you start using the repository it is a good idea to create
      new branch that will be your working branch.
      (<em>Tip: Read the "<a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">
          GitHub Guide</a></em>) You can create the branch in GitHubs web interface:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the repository page on github.com</li>
      <li>click on the <kbd>Branch: master</kbd> button, and fill in the name
        of the working branch</li>
      <li>enter the name of the working branch in the dialog, and click on the
        <kbd>Create [Branch name]</kbd> button.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The repository owner can now add the other the other group members
      as collaborators:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Goto the repository page
        (https://github.com/<em>[username]/ [repositoryname]</em>)</li>
      <li>Click on settings (upper right corner), then on collaborators (upper
        left corner)</li>
      <li>Enter something that will identify the new collaborator in the search
        box. Select the person you want to add in the search hitlist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Keeping your clone and working copy updated</h4>
    <p>These commands will keep your working copy, and your local
      repository up to date relative to the working branch on github</p>
    <ul><li><kbd>git pull</kbd></li>
    </ul>
